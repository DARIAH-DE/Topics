the purloined letter edgar allan poe nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio seneca at paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and meerschaum in company with my friend auguste dupin in his little back library or book-closet au troisième no rue dunôt faubourg st germain for one hour at least we had maintained profound silence while each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber for myself however was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mystery attending the murder of marie roget looked upon it therefore as something of coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur the prefect of the parisian police we gave him hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen him for several years we had been sitting in the dark and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting lamp but sat down again without doing so upon saying that he had called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had occasioned great deal of trouble if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as he forbore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had the fashion of calling everything odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities very true said dupin as he supplied his visitor with pipe and rolled toward him comfortable chair and what is the difficulty now asked nothing more in the assassination way hope oh no nothing of that nature the fact is the business is very simple indeed and make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves but then thought dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd simple and odd said dupin why yes and not exactly that either the fact is we have all been good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault said my friend what nonsense you do talk replied the prefect laughing heartily perhaps the mystery is little too plain said dupin oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea little too self-evident ha ha ha ha ha ha ho ho ho roared our visitor profoundly amused oh dupin you will be the death of me yet and what after all is the matter on hand asked why will tell you replied the prefect as he gave long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair will tell you in few words but before begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that should most probably lose the position now hold were it known that confided it to anyone proceed said or not said dupin well then have received personal information from very high quarter that certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments the individual who purloined it is known this beyond doubt he was seen to take it it is known also that it still remains in his possession how is this known asked dupin it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of the document and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it be little more explicit said well may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder certain power in certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy still do not quite understand said dupin no well the disclosure of the document to third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honour of personage of most exalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honour and peace are so jeopardized but this ascendency interposed would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber who would dare the thief said is the minister who dares all things those unbecoming as well as those becoming man the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold the document in question letter to be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it after hurried and vain endeavour to thrust it in drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon table the address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice at this juncture enters the minister his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognizes the handwriting of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret after some business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he produces letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs at length in taking leave he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow the minister decamped leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendency complete the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to very dangerous extent the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter but this of course cannot be done openly in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me than whom said dupin amid perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could suppose be desired or even imagined you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained it is clear said as you observe that the letter is still in the possession of the minister since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power with the employment the power departs true said and upon this conviction proceeded my first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge beyond all things have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design but said you are quite au fait in these investigations the parisian police have done this thing often before oh yes and for this reason did not despair the habits of the minister gave me too great advantage he is frequently absent from home all night his servants are by no means numerous they sleep at distance from their master's apartment and being chiefly neapolitans are readily made drunk have keys as you know with which can open any chamber or cabinet in paris for three months night has not passed during the greater part of which have not been engaged personally in ransacking the hotel my honour is interested and to mention great secret the reward is enormous so did not abandon the search until had become fully satisfied that the thief is more astute man than myself fancy that have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed but is it not possible suggested that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises this is barely possible said dupin the present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at moment's notice point of nearly equal importance with its possession its susceptibility of being produced said that is to say of being destroyed said dupin true observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises as for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question entirely said the prefect he has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigidly searched under my own inspection you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin presume is not altogether fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as matter of course not altogether fool said but then he is poet which take to be only one remove from fool true said dupin after long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although have been guilty of certain doggerel myself suppose you detail said the particulars of your search why the fact is we took our time and we searched everywhere have had long experience in these affairs took the entire building room by room devoting the nights of whole week to each we examined first the furniture of each apartment we opened every possible drawer and presume you know that to properly trained police-agent such thing as secret drawer is impossible any man is dolt who permits secret drawer to escape him in search of this kind the thing is so plain there is certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet then we have accurate rules the fiftieth part of line could not escape us after the cabinets we took the chairs the cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ from the tables we removed the tops why so sometimes the top of table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way but could not the cavity be detected by sounding asked by no means if when the article is deposited sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise but you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make deposit in the manner you mention letter may be compressed into thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from large knitting-needle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of chair for example you did not take to pieces all the chairs certainly not but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of most powerful microscope had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly single grain of gimlet-dust for example would have been as obvious as an apple any disorder in the gluing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as the curtains and carpets that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself we divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before the two houses adjoining exclaimed you must have had great deal of trouble we had but the reward offered is prodigious you include the grounds about the houses all the grounds are paved with brick they gave us comparatively little trouble we examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed you looked among papers of course and into the books of the library certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers we also measured the thickness of every book-cover with the most accurate measurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles you explored the floors beneath the carpets beyond doubt we removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope and the paper on the walls yes you looked into the cellars we did then said you have been making miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose fear you are right there said the prefect and now dupin what would you advise me to do to make thorough research of the premises that is absolutely needless replied am not more sure that breathe than am that the letter is not at the hotel have no better advice to give you said dupin you have of course an accurate description of the letter oh yes and here the prefect producing memorandum-book proceeded to read aloud minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the missing document soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely depressed in spirits than had ever known the good gentleman before in about month afterward he paid us another visit and found us occupied very nearly as before he took pipe and chair and entered into some ordinary conversation at length said well but what of the purloined letter presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister confound him say yes made the re-examination however as dupin suggested but it was all labour lost as knew it would be how much was the reward offered did you say asked dupin why very great deal very liberal reward don't like to say how much precisely but one thing will say that wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to anyone who could obtain me that letter the fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day and the reward has been lately doubled if it were trebled however could do no more than have done why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum really think you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter you might do little more think eh how in what way why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel in the matter eh puff puff puff do you remember the story they tell of abernethy no hang abernethy to be sure hang him and welcome but once upon time certain rich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this abernethy for medical opinion getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such now doctor what would you have directed him to take take said abernethy why take advice to be sure but said the prefect little discomposed am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it would really give fifty thousand francs to anyone who would aid me in the matter in that case replied dupin opening drawer and producing checkbook you may as well fill me up check for the amount mentioned when you have signed it will hand you the letter was astounded the prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in some measure he seized pen and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled up and signed check for fifty thousand francs and handed it across the table to dupin the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an escritoire took thence letter and gave it to the prefect this functionary grasped it in perfect agony of joy opened it with trembling hand cast rapid glance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to the door rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house without having uttered syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand thus when detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel felt entire confidence in his having made satisfactory investigation so far as his labours extended so far as his labours extended said yes said dupin the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection had the letter been deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond question have found it merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said the measures then he continued were good in their kind and well executed their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man certain set of highly ingenious resources are with the prefect sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his designs but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand and many schoolboy is better reasoner than he knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the game of even and odd attracted universal admiration this game is simple and is played with marbles one player holds in his hand number of these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he loses one the boy to whom allude won all the marbles of the school of course he had some principle of guessing and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents for example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks are they even or odd our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon the second trial he wins for he then says to himself the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second will therefore guess odd he guesses odd and wins now with simpleton degree above the first he would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that in the first instance guessed odd and in the second he will propose to himself upon the first impulse simple variation from even to odd as did the first simpleton but then second thought will suggest that this is too simple variation and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before will therefore guess even he guesses even and wins now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows termed lucky what in its last analysis is it it is merely said an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted received answer as follows when wish to find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wicked is anyone or what are his thoughts at the moment fashion the expression of my face as accurately as possible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or correspond with the expression this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to rochefoucauld to la bruyère to machiavelli and to campanella and the identification said of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent depends if understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of this identification and secondly by ill-admeasurement or rather through non-admeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in searching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it they are right in this much that their own ingenuity is faithful representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foils them of course this always happens when it is above their own and very usually when it is below they have no variation of principle in their investigations at best when urged by some unusual emergency by some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice without touching their principles what for example in this case of has been done to vary the principle of action what is all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the prefect in the long routine of his duty has been accustomed do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal letter not exactly in gimlet-hole bored in chair-leg but at least in some out-of the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge man to secrete letter in gimlet-hole bored in chair-leg and do you not see also that such recherchés nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealment disposal of the article concealed disposal of it in this rechercé manner is in the very first instance presumable and presumed and thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers and where the case is of importance or what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes when the reward is of magnitude the qualities in question have never been known to fail you will now understand what meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the prefect's examination in other words had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect its discovery would have been matter altogether beyond question this functionary however has been thoroughly mystified and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is fool because he has acquired renown as poet all fools are poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty of non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools but is this really the poet asked there are two brothers know and both have attained reputation in letters the minister believe has written learnedly on the differential calculus he is mathematician and no poet you are mistaken know him well he is both as poet and mathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the prefect you surprise me said by these opinions which have been contradicted by the voice of the world you do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence il parier replied dupin quoting from chamfort que toute idée publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car elle convenue au plus grand nombre the mathematicians grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth with an art worthy better cause for example they have insinuated the term analysis into application to algebra the french are the originators of this particular deception but if term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then analysis conveys algebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambition religio religion or homines honesti set of honourable men you have quarrel on hand see said with some of the algebraists of paris but proceed dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study the mathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths and this error is so egregious that am confounded at the universality with which it has been received mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth what is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals for example in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole in chemistry also the axiom fails in the consideration of motive it fails for two motives each of given value have not necessarily value when united equal to the sum of their values apart there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation but the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be bryant in his very learned mythology mentions an analogous source of error when he says that although the pagan fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing realities with the algebraists however who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed and the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains in short never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as point of his faith that px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where px is not altogether equal to and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavour to knock you down mean to say continued dupin while merely laughed at his last observations that if the minister had been no more than mathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check knew him however as both mathematician and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded knew him as courtier too and as bold intriguant such man considered could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action he could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected he must have foreseen reflected the secret investigations of his premises his frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success regarded only as ruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which in fact did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises felt also that the whole train of thought which was at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment he could not reflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect saw in fine that he would be driven as matter of course to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as matter of choice you will remember perhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when suggested upon our first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident yes said remember his merriment well really thought he would have fallen into convulsions the material world continued dupin abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial and thus some colour of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish description the principle of the vis inertiæ for example seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics it is not more true in the former that large body is with more difficulty set in motion than smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress again have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shop doors are the most attractive of attention have never given the matter thought said there is game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon map one party playing requires another to find given word the name of town river state or empire any word in short upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names but the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters from one end of the chart to the other these like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident but this is point it appears somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect he never once thought it probable or possible that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it but the more reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity of upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search the more satisfied became that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all full of these ideas prepared myself with pair of green spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerial hotel found at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui he is perhaps the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when nobody sees him to be even with him complained of my weak eyes and lamented the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host paid especial attention to large writing-table near which he sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one or two musical instruments and few books here however after long and very deliberate scrutiny saw nothing to excite particular suspicion at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by dirty blue ribbon from little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece in this rack which had three or four compartments were five or six visiting-cards and solitary letter this last was much soiled and crumpled it was torn nearly in two across the middle as if design in the first instance to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second it had large black seal bearing the cipher very conspicuously and was addressed in diminutive female hand to the minister himself it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack no sooner had glanced at this letter than concluded it to be that of which was in search to be sure it was to all appearance radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute description here the seal was large and black with the cipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the family here the address to the minister was diminutive and feminine there the superscription to certain royal personage was markedly bold and decided the size alone formed point of correspondence but then the radicalness of these differences which was excessive the dirt the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of and so suggestive of design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things together with the hyperobtrusive situation of this document full in the view of every visitor and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which had previously arrived these things say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect protracted my visit as long as possible and while maintained most animated discussion with the minister upon topic which knew well had never failed to interest and excite him kept my attention really riveted upon the letter in this examination committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and also fell at length upon discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt might have entertained in scrutinizing the edges of the paper observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when stiff paper having been once folded and pressed with folder is refolded in reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold this discovery was sufficient it was clear to me that the letter had been turned as glove inside out redirected and resealed bade the minister good-morning and took my departure at once leaving gold snuff-box upon the table the next morning called for the snuff-box when we resumed quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day while thus engaged however loud report as if of pistol was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by series of fearful screams and the shoutings of terrified mob rushed to casement threw it open and looked out in the meantime stepped to the card-rack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it by fac-simile so far as regards externals which had carefully prepared at my lodgings imitating the cipher very readily by means of seal formed of bread the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behaviour of man with musket he had fired it among crowd of women and children it proved however to have been without ball and the fellow was suffered to go his way as lunatic or drunkard when he had gone came from the window whither had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view soon afterward bade him farewell the pretended lunatic was man in my own pay but what purpose had you asked in replacing the letter by fac-simile would it not have been better at the first visit to have seized it openly and departed replied dupin is desperate man and man of nerve his hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests had made the wild attempt you suggest might never have left the ministerial presence alive the good people of paris might have heard of me no more but had an object apart from these considerations you know my political prepossessions in this matter act as partisan of the lady concerned for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power she has now him in hers since being unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political destruction his downfall too will not be more precipitate than awkward it is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus averni but in all kinds of climbing as catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down in the present instance have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends he is that monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of genius confess however that should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her whom the prefect terms certain personage he is reduced to opening the letter which left for him in the card-rack how did you put anything particular in it why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting at vienna once did me an evil turn which told him quite good-humouredly that should remember so as knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him thought it pity not to give him clew he is well acquainted with my ms and just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words un dessein si funeste s'il n'est digne d'atrée est digne de thyeste they are to be found in crébillon's atrée
