and me and all those times please am very little small mis'able dog!i do not understand!i do not understand the supplication of the black aberdeen pray my little body and whole span of years is thine my owner and my man for thou hast made me unto thee owe this dim distressed half-soul that hurts me so compact of every crime but none the less broken by knowledge of its naughtiness put me not from thy life tis all know if thou forsake me whither shall go thine is the voice with which my day begins thy foot my refuge even in my sins thine honour hurls me forth to testify against the unclean and wicked passing by but when thou callest they are of thy friends who readier than to make amends was thy deputy with high and low if thou dismiss me whither shall go have been driven forth on gross

meward my lord the paw accepted and for all to see the abject sinner throned upon the knee the ears bewrung and muzzle scratched because he is forgiven and all is as it was now am in thy life and since tis so that cat awaits the judgment may go sea dog when that sloop known to have been in the west indies trade for century had been repaired by mr randolph of stephano's island there arose between him and her owner mr gladstone gallop deep-draught pilot admiral retired lord heatleigh and mr winter vergil rn also retired the question how she would best sail this could only be settled on trial trips of the above committee ably assisted by lil mr randolph's mongrel fox-terrier and sometimes the commander of the hms bulleana who was the admiral's nephew lil had been slid into locker to keep dry till they reached easier water the others lay aft watching the breadths of the all-coloured seas mr gallop at the tiller which had replaced the wheel said as little as possible but condescended before that company to make his boat show off among the reefs and passages of coral where his business and delight lay mr vergil not for the first time justified himself to the commander for his handling of the great parrot problem which has been told elsewhere the commander tactfully agreed with the main principle that man beast or bird discipline must be preserved in the service and that so far mr vergil had done right in disrating by cutting off her tail-feathers josephine alias jemmy reader the west african parrot he himself had known dog his own dog in fact almost born and altogether brought up in destroyer who had not only been rated and disrated but also re-rated and promoted completely understanding the while what had happened and why come out and listen said mr randolph reaching into the locker this'll do you good lil came out limp over his hand and braced herself against the snap and jerk of sudden rip which mr gallop was cutting across he had stood in to show the admiral gallop's island whose original grantees had freed their carib slaves more than hundred years ago these had naturally taken their owners family name so that now there were many gallops gentle straight-haired men of substance and ancestry with manners to match and instinct beyond all knowledge of their home waters from panama that is to pernambuco the commander told tale of an ancient destroyer on the china station which with three others of equal seniority had been hurried over to the east coast of england when the navy called up her veterans for the war how malachi michael mike or mickey throve aboard the old makee-do on whose books he was rated as pup and learned to climb oily steel ladders by hooking his fore-feet over the rungs how he was used as tippet round his master's neck on the bridge of cold nights how he had his own special area on deck by the raft sacred to his private concerns and never did anything one hair's breadth outside it how he possessed an officers steward of the name of furze his devoted champion and trumpeter through the little flotilla which worked together on convoy and escort duties in the north sea then the wastage of war began to tell andthe commander turned to the admiral they dished me out new volunteer sub for first lieutenant youngster of nineteen with hand on him like ham and voice like pneumatic riveter though he couldn't pronounce to save himself found him sitting on the wardroom table with his cap on scratching his leg he said to me well old top and what's the big idea for to-mowwow agony told him and bit more he wasn't upset he was really grateful for hint how things were run on big ships as he called em makee-do was three hundred ton think he'd served in coastal motor boats retrieving corpses off the cornish coast he told me his skipper was vet who called the swells fuwwows and thought he ought to keep between em his name was eustace cyril chidden and his papa was sugar-refiner surprise was here expressed in various quarters mr winter vergil adding few remarks on the decadence of the new navy no said the commander the old top business had nothing to do with it he just didn't know that was all but mike took to him at once well we were booted out one night later on special duty no marks or lights of course raining and confused seas as soon as i'd made an offing ordered him to take the bridge cyril trots up his boots greased the complete no mike and stood by in the chart-room pretty soon he told off old shide our torpedo coxswain for being quarter-point off his course he was too but he wasn't pleased bit later cyril ships his steam-riveter voice and tells him he's all over the card and if he does it again he'll be welieved it went on like this the whole trick michael and me waiting for shide to mutiny when shide came off asked him what he thought we'd drawn either dud or diamond says shide there's no middle way with that muster that gave me the notion that cyril might be worth kicking so we all had hack at him he liked it he did indeed he said it was so intewesting because makee-do steered like witch and no one ever dreamed of trying to steer cmb's they must have been bloody pirates in that trade too he was used to knocking men about to make em attend he threatened stay-maker apprentice they were pushing all sorts of shore-muckings at us for imitating his lisp it was smoothed over but the man made the most of it he was bolshie before we knew what to call em he kicked michael once when he thought no one was looking but furze saw and the blighter got his head cut on hatch-coaming that didn't make him any sweeter twenty-thousand ton liner full of thirsty passengers passed them on the horizon mr gallop gave her name and that of the pilot in charge with some scandal as to her weakness at certain speeds and turns not so good sea-boat as her he pointed at square-faced tug or but little larger punching dazzle-white wedges out of indigo-blue the admiral stood up and pronounced her north sea mine-sweeper was ferry-boat now said mr gallop never been stopped by weather since ten years the commander shuddered aloud as the old thing shovelled her way along but she sleeps dry he said we lived in foot of water our decks leaked like anything we had to shore our bulkheads with broomsticks practically every other trip most of our people weren't broke to the life and it made em sticky had to tighten things up the admiral and mr vergil nodded then one day chidden came to me and said there was some feeling on the lower deck because mike was still rated as pup after all his sea-time he thought our people would like him being promoted to dog asked who'd given em the notion me says cyril think it'll help de-louse em mowally of course instructed him to go to hell and mind his own job then notified that mike was to be borne on the ship's books as able dog malachi was on the bridge when the watches were told of it they cheered fo'c sle afloat galley-fire missing as usual but they cheered that's the lower deck mr vergil rubbed hands in assent did mike know mr randolph he did he used to sniff forrard to see what the men's dinners were going to be if he approved he went and patronised em if he didn't he came to the wardroom for sharks and worcester sauce he was great free-fooder but the day he was promoted dog he trotted round all messes and threw his little weight about like an admiral's inspection uncle he wasn't larger than lil there next time we were in for boiler-clean got him brass collar engraved with his name and rating swear it was the only bit of bright work in the north sea all the war they fought to polish it oh malachi was great able dog those days but he never forgot his decencies mr randolph here drew lil's attention to this well and then our bolshie-bird oozed about saying that ship where men were treated like dogs and vice versa was no catch quite true if correct but it spreads despondency and attracts the baser elements you see anything's an excuse when they are hanging in the wind said mr vergil and what might you have had for the standing-part of your tackle you know as well as do vergil the old crowd gunner chief engineer cook chief stoker and torpedo cox but no denyin we were hellish uncomfy those old thirty-knotters had no bows or freeboard to speak of and no officers quarters sleep with your gunner's socks in your mouth and so on you remember em sir the admiral did when the century was young and some pirate-hunting behind muddy islands mr gallop drank it in his war experiences had ranged no further than the falklands which he had visited as one of the prize-crew of german sailing-ship picked up patagonia-way and sent south under charge of modern sub-lieutenant who had not the haziest notion how to get the canvas off barque in full career for vertical cliffs he told the tale mr randolph who had heard it before brought out meal sent by mrs vergil mr gallop laid the sloop on slant where she could look after herself while they ate lil earned her share by showing off her few small tricks mongrels are always smartest said mr randolph half defiantly don't call em mongrels the commander tweaked lil's impudent little ear mike was bit that way call em mixed there's difference the tiger-lily flush inherited from his ancestors on the mainland flared little through the brown of mr gallop's cheek right said he there's heap differ twixt mongrel and mixed and in due time so far as time was on those beryl floors they came back to the commander's tale it covered increasing discomforts and disgusts varied by escapes from being blown out of water by their own side in fog affairs with submarines arguments with pig-headed convoy-captains and endless toil to maintain makee-do abreast of her work which the growing ignorance and lowering morale of the new drafts made harder the only one of us who kept his tail up was able dog malachi he was an asset let alone being my tippet on watch used to button his front and hind legs into my coat with two turns of my comforter over all did he like it he had to it was his station in action but he had his enemies i've told you what refined person he was well one day buzz went round that he had defiled his majesty's quarterdeck furze reported it to me and as he said beggin your pardon it might as well have been any of us sir as him asked the little fellow what he had to say for himself confronting him with the circumstantial evidence of course he was very offended knew it by the way he stiffened next time took him for tippet chidden was sure there had been some dirty work somewhere but he thought court of inquiry might do good and settle one or two other things that were loose in the ship one party wanted mike disrated on the evidence they were the know em sighed mr vergil his eyes piercing the years behind him the other lot wanted to find out the man who had tampered with the the circumstantial evidence and pitch him into the ditch at that particular time we were escorting mine-sweepers every one bit jumpy saw what chidden was driving at but wasn't sure our crowd here were mariners enough to take the inquiry seriously chidden swore they were he'd been through the crystal palace training himself then said make it so waive my rights as the dog's owner discipline's discipline tell em and it may be counter-irritant the trouble was there had been fog on the morning of the crime that you couldn't spit through so no one had seen anything naturally mike sculled about as he pleased but his regular routine he slept with me and chidden in the wardroom was to take off from our stomachs about three bells in the morning watch half-past five and trot up topside to attend to himself in his own place but the evidence you see was found near the bandstand the after six pounder and accused was incapable of testifying on his own behalf well that court of inquiry had it up and down and thort-ships all the time we were covering the minesweepers it was foul area rather too close to fritz's coast we only drew seven feet so we were more or less safe our supporting cruisers lay on the edge of the area fritz had messed that up months before and lots of his warts mines had broke loose and were bobbing about and then our specialists had swept it and laid down areas of their own and so on any other time all hands would have been looking out for loose mines they have horns that nod at you in sickly-friendly frisky way when they roll but while mike's inquiry was on all hands were too worked-up over it to spare an eye outboardoh mike knew mr randolph make no mistake he knew he was in for trouble the prosecution were too crafty for him they stuck to the evidence the locus in quo and so on sentence disrating to pup again which carried loss of badge of-rank his collar furze took it off and mickey licked his hand and furze wept like peterthen mickey hoicked himself up to the bridge to tell me about it and made much of him he was distressed little dog you know how they snuffle and snuggle up when they feel hurt though the question was to mr randolph all hands answered it then our people went to dinner with this crime on their consciences those who felt that way had got in on me through michael why did you make em the chance the admiral demanded keenly to divide the sheep from the goats sir it was timewell we were second in the line how-come and fan-kwai next astern and hop hell our flagship leading withers was our senior officer we called him joss because he was always so infernally lucky it was flat calm with patches of fog and our sweepers finished on time while we were escorting em back to our cruisers joss picked up some wireless buzz about submarine spotted from the air surfacing over to the north east-probably recharging he detached how-come and fan-kwai to go on with our sweepers while him and me went-look see we dodged in and out of fog-patches two-mile visibility one minute and blind as bandage the next-then bit of zincy sun like photograph and so on well breaking out of one of these patches we saw submarine recharging-hatches open and man on deck not mile off our port quarter we swung to ram and as he came broadside on to us saw hop-hell slip mouldie fire torpedo at him and my gunner naturally followed suit by the mercy god they both streaked ahead and astern him because the chap on deck began waving an open brolly at us like an old maid hailing bus that fetched us up sliding on our tails as you might say then he said what do you silly bastards think you're doin he was conolly and some of his crowd had told us ashore that the brolly was his private code that's why we didn't fire on sight sir red conolly not black he told us he'd gone pretty close inshore on spec the night before and had been hunted bit and had to lie doggo and he'd heard three or four big ships go over him he told us where that was and we stood by till he'd finished recharging and we gave him his position and he sculled off he said it was hellish thick over towards the coast but there seemed to be something doing there so we proceeded on the tip conolly gave usoh wait minute joss's gunner prided himself on carrying all the silhouettes of fritz's navy in his fat head and he had sworn that conolly's craft was the duplicate of some dam u-boat hence his shot believe joss pretty well skinned him for it but that didn't alter the fact we'd only one mouldie apiece left to carry on with presently joss fetched sharp sheer to port and saw his bow-wave throw off something that looked like the horns of mine but they were only three or four hock bottles we don't drink hock much at sea mr randolph and mr gallop smiled there are few liquors that the inhabitants of stephano's island do not know bottled barrelled or quite loose the commander continued then joss told me to come alongside and hold his hand because he felt nervous the commander here explained how with proper arrangement of fenders trusty torpedo cox at the wheel and not too much roll on destroyers of certain types can run side by side close enough for their captains to talk even confidentially to each other he ended we used to slam those old dowagers about like sampans you youngsters always think you discovered navigation said the admiral where did you steal your fenders from that was chidden's pigeon in port sir he was the biggest thief bar three in the service cmb's are bad schoolso then we proceeded bridge to bridge chinning all comfy joss said those hock bottles and the big ships walking over conolly interested him strangely it was shoaling and we more or less made out the set of the tide we didn't chuck anything overboard though and just about sunset in clear patch we passed another covey of hock bottles mike spotted them first he used to poke his little nose up under my chin if he thought was missing anything then it got blind-thick as conolly said it would and there was an ungodly amount of gibber on the wireless joss said it sounded like fritz tip-and run raid somewhere and we might come in handy if the fog held you couldn't see the deck from the bridge he said i'd better hand him over my surviving mouldie because he was going to slip em himself hence forward and back his own luck my tubes were nothing to write home about anyhow so we passed the thing over and proceeded we cut down to bare steerage-way at last you couldn't see your hand before your face by then and we listened you listen better in fog but it doesn't give you your bearings said mr gallop earnestly true then you fancy you hear things like we did then mike began poking up under my chin again he didn't imagine things passed the word to joss and minute or two after we heard voices they sounded miles away joss said that's the hock-bottler he's hunting his home channel hope he's too bothered to worry about us but if this stuff lifts we'll wish we were conolly buttoned mike well in to me bosom and took an extra turn of my comforter round him and those ghastly voices started again up in the air this time and all down my neck then something big went astern both screws then ahead dead slow then shut off joss whispered he's atop of us said not yet mike's winding him to starboard the little chap had his head out of my comforter again sniffin and poking my chinand then by god the blighter slid up behind us to starboard we couldn't see him we felt him take what wind there was and we smelt him hot and sour he was passing soundings to the bridge by voice suppose he thought he was practically at home joss whispered go ahead and cuddle him till you hear me yap then amuse him shall slip my second by the flare of his batteries while he's trying to strafe you so he faded off to port and went ahead slow oh perishing slow shide swore afterwards that he made out the loom of the brute's stern just in time to save his starboard propeller that was when my heart stopped working then heard my port fenders squeak like wet cork along his side and there we were cuddling the hock-bottler if you lie close enough to anything big he can't theoretically depress his guns enough to get you mr gallop smiled again he had known that game played in miniature by motor-launch off the bahamas under the flaring bows of foreign preventive boat funny to lie up against big ship eaves-dropping that way we could hear her fans and engine-room bells going and some poor devil with deuce of cough don't know how long it lasted but all that awful while fritz went on with his housekeeping overhead i'd sent shide aft to the relieving tackles had an idea the wheel might go and put chidden on the twelve-pounder on the bridge my gunner had the forward six-pounders and kept makee-do cuddling our friend then heard joss yap once and then the devil of clang he'd got his first shot home we got in three rounds of the twelve and the sixes cut into her naked skin at-oh fifteen feet it must have been then we all dived aft my ewe-torpedo wouldn't have been any use anyhow the head would have hit her side before the tail was out of the tube she woke up and blazed off all starboard batteries but she couldn't depress to hit us the blast of em was enough though it knocked us deaf and sick and silly it pushed my bridge and the twelve-pounder over to starboard in heap like set of fire-irons and it opened up the top of the forward funnel and flared it out like tulip she put another salvo over us that winded us again mind you we couldn't hear that we felt it then we were jarred sideways sort of cow-kick and thought it was finish then there was sort of ripping woolly feel not noise in the air and saw the haze of big gun's flash streaking up overhead at abou thirty degrees it occurred to me that she was rolling away from us and it was time to stand clear so we went astern bit and that haze was the only sight got of her from first to last!after while we felt about to take stock of the trouble our bridge-wreckage was listing us good deal to starboard the funnel spewed smoke all over the shop and some of the stays were cut wireless smashed compasses crazy of course raft and all loose fittings lifted overboard hatches and such-like strained or jammed and the deck leaking shade more than usual but no casualties few ratings cut and bruised by being chucked against things and of course general bleeding from the nose and ears but funny thing we all shook like palsy that lasted longest we all went about shouting and shaking shock suppose and mike mr randolph asked oh he was all right he had his teeth well into my comforter throughout first thing after action he hopped down to the wardroom and lapped up pints then he tried to dig the gas taste out of his mouth with his paws then he wanted to attend to himself but he found all his private area gone west with the other unsecured gadgets he was very indignant and told furze about it furze bellows into my ear that's proof it couldn't have been him on the quarterdeck sir because if ever any one was justified in being promiscuous now would be the time but e's as dainty as duchess"laugh away it wasn't any laughing matter for don miguel beg his pardon how did you settle his daintiness said the admiral gave him special leave to be promiscuous and just because laughed he growled like young tigeryou mayn't believe what comes next but it's fact five minutes later the whole ship was going over mike's court-martial once again they were digging out like beavers to repair damage and chinning at the top of their voices and year no six months before half of em were crystal palace naval exhibits same with shanghaied hands said mr gallop putting her about with nudge of his shoulder on the tiller and some almost imperceptible touch on sheet the wind was rising ran out of that fog at last like running out of tunnel worked my way off shore more or less by soundings till picked up star to go home by arguin that joss ud do about the same waited for him while we went on cutting away what was left of the bridge and restaying the funnel it was flat calm still the coast-fog lying all along like cliffs as far as you could see dramatic too because when the light came joss shot out of the fog three or four miles away and hared down to us clearing his hawsers for tow we did look rather dung-barge signalled we were all right and good for thirteen knots which was one dam liewellso then we proceeded line-ahead and joss sat on his depth-charge rack aft semaphoring all about it to me on my fo'c sle-head he had landed the hock-bottler to port with his first shot his second it touched off her forward magazine was my borrowed one but he reported it as torpedo from the deck of my second in command she was showing blaze through the fog then so it was sitting shot at about hundred yards he thought he never saw any more of her than did but he smelt lot of burnt cork she might have been some old craft packed with cork like life-boat for tip-and run raid we never knew even in that short time the wind and the purpose of the waves had strengthened all right said mr gallop nothin due fore to-morrow but mr randolph under sailing-orders from mrs vergil had the oilskins out ere the sloop lay down to it in earnest then after that said he well then we proceeded joss flag-wagging me his news and all hands busy on our funnel and minor running-repairs but all arguin mike's case hotter than ever and all of us shaking where was mike mr randolph asked as cut wave-top slashed across the deck doing tippet for me on the fo'c sle and telling me about his great deeds he never barked but he could chin like peke then joss changed course thought it might be mines but having no bridge had no command of sight then we passed torpedo-bearded man lolling in life-belt with his head on his arms squinting at us like drunk at pubdead quiteyou never can tell how the lower deck'll take anything they stared at it and our cook said it looked saucy that was all then furze screeched but for the grace god that might be bloody-all of us and he carried on with that bit of the marriage service ree-quire an charge you as ye shall answer at the day of judgment which blinkin hound of you tampered with the evidence re malachi remember that beggar out in the wet is listenin sounds silly but it gave me the creeps at the time heard the bolshie say that joke was joke if took in the right spirit then there was bit of mix-up round the funnel but of course was busy swapping yarns with joss when went aft didn't hurry our chief stoker was standing over furze while chidden and shide were fending off small crowd who were lusting for the bolshie's blood he had punch too cywil it looked to me but couldn't have sworn to it that the chief stoker scraped up knife with his foot and hoofed it overboard knife the shocked admiral interrupted wardroom knife sir with ground edge on it furze had been leicester square waiter or pimp or something for ten years and he'd contracted foreign habits by the time took care to reach the working-party they were carrying on like marionettes because they hadn't got over their shakes you seei didn't do anything didn't expect the two men chidden had biffed ud complain of him as long as the bolshie was alive and our chief stoker had mopped up any awkward evidence against furze all things considered felt rather sorry for the bolshiechidden came to me in the wardroom afterwards and said the man had asked to be segwegated for his own safety oh yes he'd owned up to tampering with the evidence said couldn't well crime the swine for blackening dog's character but i'd reinstate and promote michael and the lower deck might draw their own conclusions then they'll kill the bolshie says the young un no said cmb's don't know everything cywil they'll put the fear of death on him but they won't scupper him what's he doing now weconstwucting mike's pwivate awea with shide and furze standing over him gwinding their teeth then he's safe said i'll send mike up to see if it suits him but what about dawkins and pratt those were the two men cyril had laid out while the chief stoker was quenching the engine-room ratings they didn't love the bolshie either full of beans and blackmail he says told em i'd saved em fwom being hung but they want sardine-supper for all hands when we get in but what's chief stoker doin on the upper deck said mr vergil peevishly as he humped his back against solid douche preserving discipline ours could mend anything from the wardroom clock to the stove and he'd make sailor of anything on legs same as you used to mr vergilwell and so we proceeded and when chidden reported the awea fit for use sent mike up to test it did mike know said mr randolph don't ask me what he did or didn't or you might call me liar the bolshie apologised to malachi publicly after chidden gave out that i'd promoted him to warrant dog for conspicuous gallantwy in action and giving valuable information as to enemy's whaiwabouts in course of same so furze put his collar on again and gave the bolshie his name and rating the commander quoted it self-explanatory indeed but not such as the meanest in his majesty's service would care to answer to even for one day it went through the whole flotilla the commander repeated it while the others laughed those gross laughs women find so incomprehensible did he stay on said mr vergil because knew stoker in the old minotaur who cut his throat for half as much as that it takes em funny sometimes he stayed with us all right but he experienced change of heart mr vergil i've seen such in my time said the ancient the admiral nodded to himself mr gallop at the tiller half rose as he peered under the foresail preparatory to taking short-cut where the coral gives no more second chance than tiger's paw in half an hour they were through that channel in an hour they had passed the huge liner tied up and discharging her thirsty passengers opposite the liquor-shops that face the quay some who could not suffer the four and half minutes walk to the nearest hotel had already run in and come out tearing the wrappings off the whisky bottles they had bought mr gallop held on to the bottom of the harbour and fetched up with sliding curtsey beneath the mangroves by the boat-shed don't know whether i've given you quite the right idea about my people said the commander at the end used to tell em they were the foulest collection of sweeps ever forked up on the beach in some ways they were but don't want you to make any mistake when it came to pinch they were the salt of the earth the very salt of god's earth blast em and bless em not that it matters much now we've got no navy his apologies master this is thy servant he is rising eight weeks old he is mainly head and tummy his legs are uncontrolled but thou hast forgiven his ugliness and settled him on thy knee

teem treasure-hunter there's gentleman of france better met by choice than chance where there's time to turn aside and space to flee he is born and bred and made for the cattle-droving trade and they call him monsieur bouvier de brie what brie yes brie where those funny cheeses come from oui oui oui but his name is great through gaul as the wisest dog of all and france pays high for bouvier de brie de brie c'est lui and if you read my story you will see what one loyal little heart thought of life and love and art and notably of bouvier de brie my friend the vicomte bouvier de brie nothing could prevent my adored mother from demanding at once the piece of sugar which was her just reward for every truffle she found my revered father on the other hand contented himself with the strict practice of his art so soon as that pierre our master stooped to dig at the spot indicated my father moved on to fresh triumphs from my father inherit my nose and perhaps touch of genius from my mother practical philosophy without which even genius is but bird of one wing in appearance my parents come of race built up from remote times on the gifted of various strains the fine flower of it to-day is small of rich gold touched with red pricked and open ears broad and receptive brow eyes of intense but affable outlook and nose in itself an inspiration and unerring guide is it any wonder then that my parents stood apart from the generality yet would not make light of those worthy artisans who have to be trained by persons to the pursuit of truffles they are of many stocks and possess many virtues but not the nose that gift which is incommunicable myself am not large at birth indeed was known as the dwarf but my achievements early won me the title of the abb\e it was easy do not recall that was ever trained by any person watched imitated and at need improved upon the technique of my parents among the little thin oaks of my country where the best truffles are found and that which to the world seemed chain of miracles was for me as easy as to roll in the dust my small feet could walk the sun up and down across the stony hill crests where we worked my well-set coat turned wet wind and cold and my size enabled me to be carried on occasion in my master's useful outside pocket my companions of those days at first pluton and dis the solemn dewlapped black mated pair who drew the little wooden cart whence my master dispensed our truffles at the white chateau near our village and to certain shopkeepers in the street of the fountain where the women talk those two of us were peasants in grain they made clear to me the significance of the flat round white pieces and the thin papers which my master and his mate buried beneath the stone by their fireplace not only truffles but all other things pluton told me turn into pieces or thin papers at last but my friend of friends my preceptor my protector my life-long admiration was monsieur le vicomte bouvier de brie marshal of bulls whom he controlled in the stony pastures near the cottage there were many sheep also with whom neither the vicomte nor was concerned mutton is bad for the nose and as have reason to know for the disposition he was of race too born as was and so accepted me when with the rash abandon of puppyhood attached myself to his ear in place of abolishing me which he could have done with one of his fore-paws he lowered me gently between both of them so that lay blinking up the gaunt cliff of his chest into his unfathomable eyes and little bad one he said but prophesy thou wilt go far here fenced by those paws would repair for my slumbers to avoid my enemies or to plague him with questions and when he went to the railway station to receive or despatch more bulls would march beneath his belly hurling infantile insults at the craven doggerie of the street of the fountain after was expert in my art he would talk to me of his own breaking off with some thunder of command to young bull who presumed to venture too near the woods where our truffles grow or descending upon him like hail across walls which his feet scorned to touch his strength his audacity overwhelmed me he on his side was frankly bewildered by my attainments but how how little one is it done your business could not convey to him nor he to me the mystery of our several arts yet always unweariedly he gave me the fruits of his experience and philosophy recall day when had chased chicken which for the moment represented to me sufficiently gross bull of salers there seemed possibility of chastisement at the hands of the owner and refuged me beneath my friend's neck where he watched in the sun he listened to my foolish tale and said as to himself these bulls of mine are but beef fitted with noses and tails by which one regulates them but these black hidden lumps of yours which only such as you can unearth that is business beyond me should like to add it to my repertoire and cried my second teeth were just pushing will be driver of bulls little one he responded with infinite tenderness here is one thing for us both to remember outside his art an artist must never dream about my fifteenth month found myself brother to four who wearied me at the same time there was change in my master's behaviour never having had any regard for him was the quicker to notice his lack of attention my mother as always said if it is not something it is sure to be something else my father simply at all hazards follow your art that can never lead to false scent there came person of abominable odours to our cottage not once but many times one day my master worked me in his presence demonstrated through long day of changing airs with faultless precision after supper my master's mate said to him we are sure of at least two good workers for next season and with dwarf one never knows it is far off that england the man talks of finish the affair pierril some thin papers passed from hand to hand the person then thrust me into his coat-pocket ours is not breed to be shown to all and there followed for me alternations of light and dark in stink-carts period when my world rose and rolled till was sick silence beside lapping water under stars transfer to another person whose scent and speech were unintelligible another flight by stink-cart burst of sunrise between hedges scent of sheep violent outcries and rockings finally dissolution of the universe which projected me through hedge from which saw my captor lying beneath the stink cart where large black-and white she bit him with devotion ditch led me to the shelter of culvert composed myself within till the light was suddenly blocked out by the head of that very she who abused me savagely in lingua canina my father often recommended me never to reply to strange she was glad when her master's voice recalled this one to her duties and heard the clickety of her flock's feet above my head in due time issued forth to acquaint myself with this world into which had been launched it was new in odour and aspect but with points of likeness to my old one clumps of trees fringed close woods and smooth green pastures and at the bottom of shallow basin crowned with woodland stood white chateau even larger than the one to which pluton and dis used to pull their cart kept me among the trees and was congratulating my nose on its recovery from the outrageous assaults it had suffered during my journeys when there came to it the unmistakable aroma of truffles not indeed the strawberry-scented ones of my lost world but like enough to throw me into my working-pose took wind and followed up my line was not deceived there were truffles of different sorts in their proper places under those thick trees my mother's maxim had proved its truth this was evidently the something else of which she had spoken and felt myself again my own equal as worked amid the almost familiar odours it seemed to me that all that had overtaken me had not happened and that at any moment should meet pluton and dis with our cart but they came not though called they did not come far-off voice interrupted me with menace recognised it for that of the boisterous she of my culvert and was still after cautious circuits heard the sound of spade and in wooded hollow saw person flattening earth round pile of wood heaped to make charcoal it was business had seen often my nose assured me that the person was authentically peasant and recalled the memory later had not handled one of us within the time that such scent would hang on him my nose further recorded that he was imbued with the aromas proper to his work and was also kind gentle and equable in temperament you persons wonder that all of us know your moods before you yourselves realise them be well sure that every shade of his or her character habit or feeling cries itself aloud in person's scent no more than we all can deceive each other can you persons deceive us though we pretend we pretend to believe his coat lay on bank when he drew from it bread and cheese produced myself but had been so long at gaze that my shoulder bruised in transit through the hedge made me fall he was upon me at once and with strength equal to his gentleness located my trouble evidently though the knowledge even then displeased me he knew how we should be handled submitted to his care ate the food he offered and reposing in the crook of his mighty arm was borne to small cottage where he bathed my hurt set water beside me and returned to his charcoal slept lulled by the cadence of his spade and the bouquet of natural scents in the cottage which included all those was used to except garlic and strangely truffles was roused by the entry of she-person who moved slowly and coughed there was on her speak now as we speak the taint of the fear of that black fear which bids us throw up our noses and lament she laid out food the person of the spade entered fled to his knee he showed me to the girl-person dull eyes she caressed my head but the chill of her hand increased the fear he set me on his knees and they talked in the twilight presently their talk nosed round hidden flat pieces and thin papers the tone was so exactly that of my master and his mate that expected they would lift up the hearthstone but theirs was in the chimney whence the person drew several white pieces which he gave to the girl argued from this they had admitted me to their utmost intimacy and confess it danced like puppy my reward was their mirth his specially when the girl laughed she coughed but his voice warmed and possessed me before knew it after night was well fallen they went out and prepared bed on cot in the open sheltered only by large faggot-stack the girl disposed herself to sleep there which astonished me in my lost world out sleeping is not done except when persons wish to avoid forest guards the person of the spade then set jug of water by the bed and turning to reenter the house delivered long whistle it was answered across the woods by the unforgettable voice of the old she of my culvert inserted myself at once between and little beneath some of the more robust faggots on her silent arrival the she greeted the girl with extravagant affection and fawned beneath her hand till the coughings closed in uneasy slumber then with no more noise than the moths of the night she quested for me in order she said to tear out my throat ma tante replied placidly from within my fortress do not doubt you could save yourself the trouble by swallowing me alive but first tell me what have done that there is my bone was the reply it was enough once in my life had seen poor honest pluton stand like raging wolf between his pierril whom he loved and forest guard we use that word seldom and never lightly therefore answered assure you she is not mine she gives me the black fear you know how we cannot deceive each other the she accepted my statement at the same time reviling me for my lack of appreciation crookedness of mind not uncommon among elderly shes to distract her invited her to tell me her history it appeared that the girl had nursed her through some early distemper since then the she had divided her life between her duties among sheep by day and watching from the first star till break of light over the girl who she said also suffered from slight distemper this had been her existence her joy and her devotion long before was born demanding nothing more she was prepared to back her single demand by slaughter once in my second month when would have run away from very fierce frog my friend the vicomte told me that at crises it is best to go forward on sudden impulse emerged from my shelter and sat beside her there was pause of life and death during which had leisure to contemplate all her teeth fortunately the girl waked to drink the she crawled to caress the hand that set down the jug and waited till the breathing resumed she came back to me had not stirred with blazing eyes how can you dare this she said but why not answered if it is not something it is sure to be something else her fire and fury passed to whom do you say it she assented there is always something else to fear not for myself but for my bone yonder then began conversation unique should imagine even among ourselves my old unlovely savage aunt as shall henceforth call her was eaten alive with fears for the girl not so much on account of her distemper but because of two she-persons enemies whom she described to me minutely by eye and nose one like ferret the other like goose these she said meditated some evil to the girl against which my aunt and the girl's father the person of the spade were helpless the two enemies carried about with them certain papers by virtue of which the girl could be taken away from the cottage and my aunt's care precisely as she had seen sheep taken out of her pasture by persons with papers and driven none knew whither the enemies would come at intervals to the cottage in daytime when my aunt's duty held her with the sheep and always they left behind them the taint of misery and anxiety it was not that she feared the enemies personally she feared nothing except certain monsieur the law who understood later cowed even her naturally sympathised did not know this gentilhommier de loire but knew fear also the girl was of the same stock as he who had fed and welcomed me and whose voice had reassured my aunt suddenly demanded if purposed to take up my residence with them would have detailed to her my adventures she was acutely uninterested in them all except so far as they served her purposes which she explained she would allow me to live on condition that reported to her nightly beside the faggot-stack all had seen or heard or suspected of every action and mood of the girl during the day any arrival of the enemies as she called them and whatever might gather from their gestures and tones in other words was to spy for her as those of us who accompany the forest guards spy for their detestable masters was not disturbed had had experience of the forest guard still there remained my dignity and something which suddenly felt was even more precious to me ma tante said what do depends not on you but on my bone in the cottage there she understood what is there on him she said to draw you such things are like truffles was my answer they are there or they are not there do not know what truffles may be she snapped he has nothing useful to me except that he too fears for my girl at any rate your infatuation for him makes you more useful as an aid to my plans we shall see said but to talk of affairs of importance do you seriously mean that you have no knowledge of truffles she was convinced that mocked her is it she demanded some lapdog's trick she said this of truffles of my truffles the impasse was total outside of the girl on the cot and her sheep for can testify that with them she was an artist the square box of my aunt's head held not one single thought my patience forsook me but not my politeness cheer-up old one said an honest heart outweighs many disadvantages of ignorance and low birth and she thought she would have devoured me in my hair when she could speak she made clear that she was born entirely soof breed mated and trained since the days of the first shepherd in return explained that was specialist in the discovery of delicacies which the genius of my ancestors had revealed to persons since the first person first scratched in the first dirt she did not believe me nor do pretend that had been entirely accurate in my genealogy but she addressed me henceforth as my nephew thus that wonderful night passed with the moths the bats the owls the sinking moon and the varied respirations of the girl at sunrise call broke out from beyond the woods my aunt vanished to her day's office went into the house and found him lacing one gigantic boot its companion lay beside the hearth brought it to him had seen my father do as much for that pierrounet my master he was loudly pleased he patted my head and when the girl entered told her of my exploit she called me to be caressed and though the black taint upon her made me cringe came she belonged to him as at that moment realised that did here began my new life by day accompanied him to his charcoal sole guardian of his coat and the bread and cheese on the bank or remembering my aunt's infatuation fluctuated between the charcoal mound and the house to spy upon the girl when she was not with him he was all that desired in the sound of his solid tread his deep but gentle voice the sympathetic texture and scent of his clothes the safe hold of his hand when he would slide me into his great outer pocket and carry me through the far woods where he dealt secretly with rabbits like peasants who are alone more than most persons he talked aloud to himself and presently to me asking my opinion of the height of wire from the ground my devotion he accepted and repaid from the first my art he could by no means comprehend for naturally followed my art as every artist must even when it is misunderstood if not he comes to preoccupy himself mournfully with his proper fleas my new surroundings the larger size and closer spacing of the oaks the heavier nature of the soils the habits of the lazy wet winds hundred considerations which the expert takes into account demanded changes and adjustments of my techniquemy reward found and brought him truffles of the best nosed them into his hand laid them on the threshold of the cottage and they filled it with their fragrance he and the girl thought that amused myself and would throw throw them for me to retrieve as though they had been stones and puppy what more could do the scent over that ground was lost but the rest was happiness tempered with vivid fears when we were apart lest if the wind blew beyond moderation tree might fall and crush him lest when he worked late he might disappear into one of those terrible river pits so common in the world whence had come and be lost without trace there was no peril did not imagine for him till could hear his feet walking securely on sound earth long before the girl had even suspected thus my heart was light in spite of the nightly conferences with my formidable aunt who linked her own dismal apprehensions to every account that rendered of the girl's day-life and actions for some cause or other the two enemies had not appeared since my aunt had warned me against them and there was less of fear in the house perhaps as once hinted to my aunt owing to my presence it was an unfortunate remark should have remembered her gender she attacked me that night on new scent bidding me observe that she herself was decorated with collar of office which established her position before all the world was about to compliment her when she observed in the low even tone of detachment peculiar to shes of age that unless were so decorated not only was outside the law that person of whom might remember she had often spoken but could not be formally accepted into any household how then demanded might come by this protection in her own case she said the collar was hers by right as preceptress of sheep to procure collar for me would be matter of pieces or even of thin papers from his chimney recalled poor pluton's warning that everything changes at last into such things if he chose to give of his pieces for my collar my civil status would be impregnable otherwise having no business or occupation lived said my aunt like the rabbits by favour and accident but ma tante cried have the secret of an art beyond all others that is not understood in these parts she replied you have told me of it many times but do not believe what pity it is not rabbits you are small enough to creep down their burrows but these precious things of yours under the ground which no one but you can find it is absurd it is an absurdity then which fills persons chimney-places with pieces and thin papers listen ma tante all but howled the world came from was stuffed with things underground which all persons desired this world here is also rich in them but alone can bring them to light she repeated acridly here is not there it should have been rabbits turned to go was at the end of my forces you talk too much of the world whence you came my aunt sneered where is that world do not know answered miserably and crawled under my faggots as matter of routine when my report had been made to my aunt would take post on the foot of his bed where should be available in case of bandits but my aunt's words had barred that ever-open door my suspicions worked like worms in my system if he chose he could kick me off on to the floor beyond sound of his desired voice into the rabid procession of fears and flights whence he had delivered me whither then should go?there remained only my lost world where persons knew the value of truffles and of those of us who could find them would seek that world with this intention and bitterness in my belly as though had mouthed toad came out after dawn and fled to the edge of the woods through which he and had wandered so often they were bounded by tall stone wall along which quested for an opening found none till reached small house beside shut gates here an officious one of us advanced upon me with threats was in no case to argue or even to expostulate hastened away and attacked the wall again at another point but after while found myself back at the house of the officious one recommenced my circuit but there was no end to that wall remembered crying aloud to it in hope it might fall down and pass me through remember appealing to the vicomte to come to my aid remember flight of big black birds calling the very name of my lost world aa or above my head but soon they scattered in all directions only the wall continued to continue and blindly at its foot once she-person stretched out her hand towards me fled as fled from an amazed rabbit who like myself existed by favour and accident another person coming upon me threw stones this turned me away from the wall and so broke its attraction subsided into an aimless limp of hours until some woods that seemed familiar received me into their shades found me at the back of the large white chateau in the hollow which had seen only once far off on the first day of my arrival in this world looked down through bushes on to ground divided by strips of still water and stone here were birds bigger than turkeys with enormous voices and tails which they raised one against the other while white-haired she-person dispensed them food from pan she held between sparkling hands my nose told me that she was unquestionably of race-descended from champion strains would have crawled nearer but the greedy birds forbade retreated uphill into the woods and moved by know not what agonies of frustration and bewilderment threw up my head and lamented the harsh imperative call of my aunt cut through my self-pity found her on duty in pastures still bounded by that wall which encircled my world she charged me at once with having some disreputable affair and for its sake deserting my post with the girl could but pant seeing at last my distress she said have you been seeking that lost world of yours shame closed my mouth she continued in softer tones except when it concerns my bone do not take all that say at full-fang there are others as foolish as you wait my return she left me with an affectation almost coquetry of extreme fatigue to her charge had been added new detachment of sheep who wished to escape they had scattered into separate crowds each with different objective and different speed my aunt keeping the high ground allowed them to disperse till her terrible voice thrice lifted brought them to halt then in one long loop of flight my aunt dumb fury lying wide on their flank swept down with certainty speed and calculation which almost reminded me of my friend the vicomte those diffuse and errant imbeciles reunited and inclined away from her in mob of mixed smells and outcries to find themselves exquisitely penned in an angle of the fence my aunt laid flat at full length facing them one after another their heads dropped and they resumed their eternal business of mutton-making my aunt came back her affectation of decrepitude heightened to heighten her performance and who was an artist also to mock her you wonder why my temper is not of the bluntest she said you could not have done that but at least can appreciate it cried it was superb it was unequalled it was faultless you did not even nip one of them with sheep that is to confess failure she said do you then gnaw your truffles it was the first time that she had ever admitted their existence my genuine admiration none the worse for little flattery opened her heart she spoke of her youthful triumphs at sheep herding expositions of rescues of lost lambs or incapable mothers found reversed in ditches oh she was all an artist my thin flanked haggard-eyed aunt by enforced adoption she even let me talk of the vicomte suddenly the shadows had stretched she leaped with grace should never have suspected on to stone wall and stood long at far gaze enough of this nonsense she said brutally you are rested now get to your work if you could see my nephew you would observe the ferret and the goose walking there three fields distant they have come again for my bone they will keep to the path made for persons go at once to the cottage before they arrive and do what you can to harass them run run mountebank of yellow imbecile that you are turned on my tail as we say and took the direct line through my well-known woods at my utmost speed since her orders dispatched me without loss of dignity towards my heart's one desire and was received by him and by the girl with unfeigned rapture they passed me from one to the other like the rarest of truffles rebuked me not too severely for my long absence felt me for possible injuries from traps brought me bread and milk which sorely needed and by hundred delicate attentions showed me the secure place occupied in their hearts gave my dignity to the cats and it is not too much to say that we were all engaged in veritable pas de trois when shadow fell across our threshold and the two enemies most rudely entered conceived and gave vent to instant detestation which for while delayed their attack when it came he and the girl accepted it as yoked oxen receive the lash across the eyes with the piteous dignity which earth having so little to give them bestows upon her humbles like oxen too they backed side by side and pressed closer together renewed my comminations from every angle as saw how these distracted my adversaries they then pointed passionately to me and my pan of bread and milk which joy had prevented me from altogether emptying their tongues felt were foul with reproach at last he spoke he mentioned my name more than once but always could tell in my defence the girl backed his point assisted with and it was something all that had ever heard in my lost world from the sans-kennailerie of the street of the fountain the enemies renewed the charge evidently my aunt was right their plan was to take the girl away in exchange for pieces of paper saw the ferret wave paper beneath his nose he shook his head and launched that peasant's no which is one in all languages here applauded vehemently continuously monotonously on key which also had learned in the street of the fountain nothing could have lived against it the enemies threatened could feel some prodigious action or another but at last they marched out of our presence escorted them to the charcoal-heap the limit of our private domain in silence charged with possibilities for their thick ankles returned to find my two sunk in distress but upon my account think they feared might run away again for they shut the door they frequently and tenderly repeated my name which with them was teem finally he took thin paper from the chimney-piece slid me into his outside pocket and walked swiftly to the village which had never smelt before in place where she-person was caged behind bars he exchanged the thin paper for one which he laid under my nose saying teem look this is licence-and law all-right in yet another place was set down before person who exhaled grateful flavour of dried skins my neck was then encircled by collar bearing bright badge of office all persons round me expressed admiration and said lor many times on our return through the village stretched my decorated neck out of his pocket like one of the gaudy birds at the chateau to impress those of us who might be abroad that was now under full protection of monsieur le law whoever he might be and thus the equal of my exacting aunt that night by the girl's bed my aunt was at her most difficult she cut short my history of my campaign and cross-examined me coldly as to what had actually passed her interpretations were not cheering she prophesied our enemies would return more savage for having been checked she said that when they mentioned my name as have told you it was to rebuke him for feeding me vagabond on good bread and milk when did not according to monsieur law belong to him she herself she added had often been shocked by his extravagance in this regard pointed out that my collar now disposed of inconvenient questions so much she ungraciously conceded but had described the scene to her argued that he had taken the thin paper out of its hiding-place because had cajoled him with my lapdog's tricks and that in default of that paper he would go without food as well as without what he burned under his nose which to him would be equally serious was aghast but ma tante pleaded show me make me any way to teach him that the earth on which he walks so loftily can fill his chimneys with thin papers and promise you that she shall eat chicken my evident sincerity perhaps too the finesse of my final appeal shook her she mouthed paw in thought you have shown him those wonderful underground-things of yours she resumed but often and to your girl also they thought they were stones to throw it is because of my size that am not taken seriously would have lamented but she struck me down her girl was coughing be silent unlucky that you are have you shown your truffles as you call them to anyone else those two are all have ever met in this world my aunt that was true till yesterday she replied but at the back of the chateau this afternoon eh my friend the vicomte was right when he warned me that all elderly shes have six ears and ten noses and the older the more saw that person only from distance you know her then my aunt if know her she met me once when was lamed by thorns under my left heel-pad she stopped me she took them out she also put her hand on my head alas have not your charms riposted listen before my temper snaps my nephew she has returned to her chateau lay one of those things that you say you find at her feet do not credit your tales about them but it is possible that she may she is of race she knows all she may make you that way for which you ask so loudly it is only chance but if it succeeds and my bone does not eat the chickens you have promised her will for sure tear out your throat my aunt replied am infinitely obliged you have at least shown me way what pity you were born with so many thorns under your tongue and fled to take post at the foot of his bed where slept vigorously for had lived that day till time to bring him his morning boots we then went to our charcoal as official guardian of the coat permitted myself no excursions till he was busied stopping the vents of little flames on the flanks of the mound then moved towards patch of ground which had noted long ago on my way chance of the air told me that the born one of the chateau was walking on the verge of the wood fled to my patch which was even more fruitful than had thought had unearthed several truffles when the sound of her tread hardened on the bare ground beneath the trees selecting my largest and ripest bore it reverently towards her dropped it in her path and took pose of humble devotion her nose informed her before her eyes saw it wrinkle and sniff deliciously she stooped and with sparkling hands lifted my gift to smell her sympathetic appreciation emboldened me to pull the fringe of her clothes in the direction of my little store exposed beneath the oak she knelt and rapturously inhaling their aroma transferred them to small basket on her arm all born ones bear such baskets when they walk upon their own earths here he called my name replied at once that was coming but that matters of the utmost importance held me for the moment we moved on together the born one and and found him beside his coat setting apart for me my own bread and cheese we lived we two each always in the other's life had often seen that pierrounet my master who delivered me to strangers uncover and bend at the side-door of the chateau in my lost world over yonder at no time was he beautiful but he my own bone to me though he too was uncovered stood beautifully erect and as peasant of race should bear himself when he and his are not being tortured by ferrets or geese for short time he and the born one did not concern themselves with me they were obviously of old acquaintance she spoke she waved her sparkling hands she laughed he responded gravely at dignified ease like my friend the vicomte then heard my name many times fancy he may have told her something of my appearance in this world we peasants do not tell all to any one to prove to her my character as he conceived it he threw stone with as much emphasis as my love for him allowed signified that this game of lapdogs was not mine she commanded us to return to the woods there he said to me as though it were some question of his magnificent boots seek teem find teem and waved his arms at random he did not know even then my bone did not know but was equal to the occasion without unnecessary gesture stifling the squeaks of rapture that rose in my throat coldly almost as my father made point after point picked up my lines and worked them his attendant spade saving me the trouble of digging till the basket was full at this juncture the girl they were seldom far apart appeared with all the old miseries on her face and behind her had been too occupied with my art or should have yelled on their scent walked the two enemies they had not spied us up there among the trees for they rated her all the way to the charcoal-heap our born one descended upon them softly as mist through which shine the stars and greeted them in the voice of dove out of summer foliage held me still she needed no aid that one they grew louder and more loud she increasingly more suave they flourished at her one of their detestable papers which she received as though it had been all the trufes in the world they talked of monsieur le law from her renewed smiles understood that he too had the honour of her friendship they continued to talk of himthenshe abolished them how speaking with the utmost reverence of both she reminded me of my friend the vicomte disentangling an agglomeration of distracted and therefore dangerous beefs at the railway station there was the same sage turn of the head the same almost invisible stiffening of the shoulders the very same small voice out of the side of the mouth saying charge myself with this and then and then those insupportable offspring of jumped-up gentilhommier were transformed into amiable and impressed members of their proper class giving ground slowly at first but finally evaporating yes evaporating like bad smells in the direction of the world whence they had intruded during the relief that followed the girl wept and wept and wept our born one led her to the cottage and consoled we showed her our bed beside the faggots and all our other small dispositions including bottle out of which the girl was used to drink tasted once some that had been spilt it was like unfresh fish fit only for cats she saw she heard she considered all calm came at her every word she would have given him some pieces in exchange suppose for her filled basket he pointed to me to show that it was my work she repeated most of the words she had employed before my name among them because one must explain many times to peasant who desires not to comprehend at last he took the pieces then my born one stooped down to me beside his foot and said in the language of my lost world knowest thou teem that this is all thy work without thee we can do nothing knowest thou my little dear teem if knew had he listened to me at the first the situation would have been regularised half season before now could fill his chimney-places as my father had filled that of that disgusting pierrounet logically of course should have begun fresh demonstration of my art in proof of my zeal for the interests of my famille but did not instead ran rolled leaped cried aloud fawned at their knees what would you it was hairless toothless sentiment but it had the success of hurricane they accepted me as though had been person and he more unreservedly than any of them it was my supreme moment have at last reduced my famille to the routine which is indispensable to the right-minded among us for example at intervals he and descend to the chateau with our basket of truffles for our born one if she is there she caresses me if elsewhere her basket pursues her in stink-cart so does also her chef well-scented person and can testify an artist this understand is our exchange for the right to exploit for ourselves all other truffles that may find inside the great wall these we dispense to another stink-cart filled with delightful comestibles which waits for us regularly on the stink-cart road by the house of the gate where the officious one pursued me we are paid into the hand trust us peasants in pieces or papers while stand guard against bandits as result the girl has now wooden-roofed house of her own open at one side and capable of being turned round against winds by his strong one hand here she arranges the bottles from which she drinks and here comes but less and less often dry person of mixed odours who applies his ear at the end of stick to her thin back thus and owing to the chickens which as promised my aunt she eats the taint of her distemper diminishes my aunt denies that it ever existed but her infatuation have told you has no bounds she has been given honourable demission from her duties with sheep and has frankly installed herself in the girl's outside bed-house which she does not encourage me to enter can support that too have my bone only it comes to me as it does to most of us who live so swiftly to dream in my sleep then return to my lost world to the whistling dry-leaved thin oaks that are not these giant ones to the stony little hillsides and treacherous river-pits that are not these secure pastures to the sharp scents that are not these scents to the companionship of poor pluton and dis to the street of the fountain up which marches to meet me as when was rude little puppy my friend my protector my earliest adoration monsieur le vicomte bouvier de brie at this point always wake and not till feel his foot beneath the bedderie and hear his comfortable breathing does my lost world cease to bite oh wise and well-beloved guardian and playmate of my youth it is true it is true as thou didst warn me outside his art an artist must never dream the end
